* This project was inspired by Linktree. I would like to create a website that stores all the links on my social networks;
* The site is not yet responsive;
* I'm using Fontawesome to use icons. (however, the code where I use this technology is defective);
* It is a simple and personal project, to train what I already know with HTML and CSS;
